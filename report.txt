What I have done:  [aimed to achieve 80% of marks]
  - parsed information into nodes(intersections) and edges (segments).
  - eliminated wrong-way directed edges of one-way-streets while parsing.
  - used speed limitations to try to minimise time rather than just distance.
    note: this assumes you can travel at the roads speed limit
  
  
What I haven't done:
  - turning restrictions
